# House-Prediction  

## Libraries Used  
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **NumPy** - For numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - For data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** - For model training and evaluation  

## Data Loading and Analysis  
The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand trends and correlations. Various visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps are used to identify relationships between features and the target variable (house prices).  

## Data Preprocessing  
Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical
